## Installation

Install via `composer require rinvex/category`, then include the following service provider to the `'providers'` array inside `app/config/app.php`:
``` php
Rinvex\Category\CategoryServiceProvider::class
```

Finally you'll need to execute migrations via the following command:
```
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

### Create Your Model

Simply create a new eloquent model, and use `Categorizable` trait:
``` php
<?php

namespace App;

use Rinvex\Category\Categorizable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    use Categorizable;
}

$post = new Post();
```

### Get Model Category List

The `categoriesList` method gets an array with ids and names of categories (useful for drop-downs):
``` php
$post->categoriesList();
```

### Categorize Your Model

The `categorize` method **attaches** the Post Model to the given Categories:
``` php
$post->categorize(['category-1', 'custom-category-123', 'new-category']);
```

### Uncategorize Your Model

The `uncategorize` method **detaches** the Post Model from the given Categories:
``` php
$post->uncategorize(Category::find(1));
```

### Synchronize Your Model's Categories

The `recategorize` method **synchronizes** the Post Model's cagtegories:
``` php
$post->recategorize(Category::whereIn('id', [1, 2, 3]));
```

### Check If Your Model Has Any Given Category

The `hasCategory` and it's alias `hasAnyCategory` methods determines if your model has (one of) the given categories:
``` php
$post->hasCategory([1, 2, 3]);
$post->hasAnyCategory(41);
```

### Check If Your Model Has All Given Categories

The `hasAllCategories` method determines if your model has all of the given categories:
``` php
$post->hasAllCategories(['category-1', 'custom-category-123', 'new-category']);
```

### Get All Models In Category

The `entries` method gets all of the entries that are assigned to this category:
``` php
$category = new Category();
$category->entries(\App\Post::class);
```

> **Notes:** 
> - Almost all categorizable methods can accept variety of inputs, such as: 1) single category slug; 2) single category id; 3) single category model; 4) category collection; 5) array of category slugs; 6) array of category ids; **This package is smart enough to recognize and deal with whatever inputs n these methods.**
> - This package is built upon the effecient nested-sets package [lazychaser/laravel-nestedset](https://github.com/lazychaser/laravel-nestedset), check it out for further details on how to create / update / delete / list categories and their attached items (categorizables).
